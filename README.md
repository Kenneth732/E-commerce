# This code is a simple shopping cart application implemented using JavaScript.

# handleFetchData() 
```
is an asynchronous function that fetches data from an API endpoint. The query parameter is optional and can be used to search for a specific item. The function then filters the data based on the query and maps it to an HTML string that represents the item's card. The handleRenderUsers() function calls handleFetchData() and sets the HTML of an element with an ID of "output" to the mapped HTML string.
```
# shopObj
```
 is an array that stores the items in the cart. The handleIncrement() and handleDecrement() functions update the shopObj array based on the item's ID passed as a parameter. If the item is not already in the cart, it is added with a quantity of 1. Otherwise, the quantity of the item is incremented or decremented based on the button clicked. The handleUpdate() function is called in both cases to update the HTML of the cart element with the new quantity.
```
# The handleUpdate() 
```
function searches for the item with the specified ID in the shopObj array and updates the HTML of the element with the same ID to display the new quantity. It also calls the handleArithmetic() function to update the total quantity displayed in the cart icon.
```
# The handleArithmetic() 
```
function updates the cart icon element with the total quantity of items in the cart. It does this by mapping the shopObj array to an array of quantities and then using the reduce() method to sum the values.
